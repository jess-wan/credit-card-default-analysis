**Credit Score Analysis Report**

**1. Introduction**
This report presents an analysis of credit scores based on the dataset provided in the Jupyter Notebook. The analysis involves data exploration, handling missing values, and modeling to assess credit default risks.

**2. Data Overview**
The dataset contains credit card default information, with key variables including demographic details, financial behavior, and payment history. The dataset was loaded and examined for structure and completeness.

**3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Missing values were identified and handled appropriately.
- Data types were checked and corrected where necessary.
- Outliers were detected and addressed to improve model performance.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution of credit scores and key financial metrics were visualized.
- Correlations between features were analyzed using heatmaps.
- Trends in default rates were identified based on demographic factors and payment history.

**5. Modeling**
- Various machine learning models were applied to predict credit default.
- Performance of models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- The best-performing model was selected based on these metrics.

**6. Key Findings**
- Significant factors influencing credit default were identified.
- High-risk groups were analyzed for potential intervention strategies.
- The most effective predictive model was determined.

**7. Conclusion and Recommendations**
Based on the analysis, recommendations are provided for mitigating credit default risks and improving credit scoring methodologies. Further refinements in feature engineering and data collection could enhance predictive accuracy in future studies.
